PastaBerry lets you cook pasta remotely. The typical use case is a person who, on his lunch break, has to go home and prepare his pasta dish and then return to work, or simply a very lazy individual.

All you have to do is:
* Start the server with `python3 bot/pasta_berry_bot.py`
* Write to @pasta_berry_bot on Telegram `/start_cooking [min]`, where minutes is the time your pasta has to cook in boiling water
* Wait for it to finish and enjoy your pasta!
